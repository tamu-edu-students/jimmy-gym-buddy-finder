Feature: Login Page
  As a visitor
  I want to see the login page with the correct elements
  So that I can understand the purpose of the page and log in with Google

  Background: Navigate to the login page
    Given I am on the login page

  Scenario: View the login page elements
    Then I should see the main heading "Jimmy"
    And I should see the subtitle "Your Gym Buddies Finder"
    And I should see an image with the alt text "Jimmy Logo"
    And I should see a button labeled "Login with Google"
